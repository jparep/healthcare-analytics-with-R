# Healthcare Analytics with R

Welcome to the Healthcare Analytics with R project! This project aims to perform a comprehensive data analysis using R on a publicly available healthcare dataset from Kaggle.

## Dataset

We will utilize the "Chronic Disease Indicators" dataset provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This dataset contains a cross-cutting set of 124 indicators developed by consensus to allow states and territories to uniformly define, collect, and report chronic disease data.

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Chronic Disease Indicators](https://www.kaggle.com/cdc/chronic-disease-indicators)

## Project Objectives

1. **Data Cleaning**: Prepare the dataset for analysis by handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring data consistency.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gain insights into the dataset through visualizations and summary statistics.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Perform statistical tests to identify significant relationships and trends within the data.
4. **Predictive Modeling**: Build predictive models to forecast chronic disease indicators based on the available data.
5. **Reporting**: Summarize findings and present them in a clear and concise manner.

## Tools and Libraries

- **R**: The primary programming language used for data analysis.
- **tidyverse**: A collection of R packages for data manipulation and visualization.
- **ggplot2**: A data visualization package for creating complex plots from data in a data frame.
- **dplyr**: A grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges.
- **caret**: A package for creating predictive models.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthcare-analytics-with-R.git
    cd healthcare-analytics-with-R
    ```

2. **Install required packages**:
    ```R
    install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "caret"))
    ```

3. **Load the dataset**:
    ```R
    chronic_disease_data <- read.csv("path/to/chronic_disease_indicators.csv")
    ```
